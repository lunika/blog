title: Thelia memo book
subtitle: We released a memo book about Thelia, discover it and participate !

---
As you certainly know, Iâ€™m going to the Symfony Live in London with Benjamin at the end of september.

Thelia will be a community partner and for the event we decided (a little bit late) to edit a memo book and distribute it. We realize the memo in only 3 days and we are waiting the printed version.

We decided to share the source of this memo. All the source are in markdown and we used pandoc for exporting it in HTML. I think it would be great to create a script for exporting the memo as a real book. This kind of script already exists, see the [pro git book](https://github.com/progit/progit). Here is the pandoc documentation about how to create an ebook: [http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/epub.html](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/epub.html)

* memo source : [https://github.com/thelia/memo-book](https://github.com/thelia/memo-book)
* HTML export : [http://thelia.github.io/memo-book](http://thelia.github.io/memo-book)
* final memo book : [http://thelia.github.io/memo-book/memo-thelia.pdf](http://thelia.github.io/memo-book/memo-thelia.pdf)

Edit : The memo is real and really classy :-D
